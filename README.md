# Enqueueror

Enqueueror enables WordPress developers to efficiently develop and manage their CSS & JavaScript code files, having them conditionally loaded, through the use of naming conventions and a bunch of convenient features which augment their code development workflow.

## Usage

### 1. Install Enqueueror<!-- omit in toc -->
Enqueueror is available from the official [WordPress Plugin Repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enqueueror/) as a free plugin. You may search, install and activate it from within your WordPress installation or download, upload and activate it from the plugin repository.

### 2. Create the required directories<!-- omit in toc -->
Enqueueror takes into account CSS & JavaScript assets located under two special directories in the active theme's directory. The directories should be created by the developer:

| Directory Path                                              | Usage                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| /wp-content/themes/<active_theme_directory>/**stylesheets** | Contains CSS assets        |
| /wp-content/themes/<active_theme_directory>/**scripts**     | Contains JavaScript assets |
