# Enqueueror
Enqueueror empowers WordPress developers to manage and develop their CSS & JavaScript files efficiently. It facilitates conditional CSS & JavaScript loading through the use of naming conventions and provides numerous features to enhance the code development workflow.

## Usage
### 1. Install Enqueueror<!-- omit in toc -->
Enqueueror is available as a free plugin from the official [WordPress Plugin Repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enqueueror/). You can search for, install, and activate it directly from your WordPress installation, or download it from the plugin repository, upload, and then activate it.

### 2. Create the required directories<!-- omit in toc -->
Enqueueror processes CSS & JavaScript assets stored in two specific directories within the active theme's directory. These directories need to be created by the developer:

| Directory Path                                              | Usage                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| /wp-content/themes/<active_theme_directory>/**stylesheets** | Contains CSS assets        |
| /wp-content/themes/<active_theme_directory>/**scripts**     | Contains JavaScript assets |
